# Workshop No. 2
## Space Ship Inventory
This is a simple project made in JAVA to develop an inventory of space ships, based on the following link [Link](https://moaramore.com/2016/05/14/clasificacion-de-las-naves-espaciales/)
I made the following classification:
- Launcher
- Unmanned Ship
- Manned Ship

I develop an abstract class SpaceShip who will be hieracly to Launcher, Unmmaned and Manned ship class. I make a simple infinite loop to make some things like create a new space ship, listen all ships created and exit the program.
